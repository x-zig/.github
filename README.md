# X-Zig: Zig Experimental Packages

Welcome to X-Zig, a curated collection of experimental packages for the Zig programming language. Our initiative parallels the concept of Golang's X packages, extending the core capabilities of Zig with essential, community-driven functionalities not included in the official Zig standard library.

## Objective

The creation of X-Zig aims to foster innovation and standardization within the Zig community, offering a repository of standardized, reusable components. These packages address common needs and encourage the sharing of best practices and solutions.

## Quality Assurance

Our maintainers are committed to ensuring the safety and reliability of the packages within X-Zig. Rigorous efforts are made to exclude malicious code and to update packages in alignment with the most recent stable release of Zig, typically within a 45-day grace period. However, it's important to note that these packages may face language and platform limitations, as well as compatibility challenges.

## Contribution Guidelines

We warmly invite contributions from developers who wish to align their Zig projects with the X-Zig standards. If you're interested in contributing, your repository should meet the following criteria:

- Dependencies
  - Only dependencies from x-zig and the Zig standard library are permitted.
- Packaging
  - Include a ZON package definition.
- Code Style
  - Adhere to the Zig formatting guidelines.
- Testing
  - Incorporate unit tests.
- Examples
  - Provide sample code demonstrating the usage of your package.
- Documentation
  - Offer documentation to assist users in understanding and implementing your package.

## Disclaimer

Please be aware that packages under X-Zig may undergo backwards incompatible changes within the same major version and do not guarantee compatibility. While these packages are not officially endorsed or scrutinized by Zig's core maintainers, X-Zig serves as a vital space for the evolution and potential standardization of Zig packages.

## Licensing

The licensing of packages within X-Zig may vary, though we recommend adopting the MIT license to maintain compatibility with the Zig ecosystem.
